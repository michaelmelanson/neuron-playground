Neuron model playground
=======================

This is an implementation of a Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model as
described by (Steur, 2006).

It uses the GNU Scientific Library for numeric integration, ZeroMQ for
internal messaging and pthread for threading.


Usage
-----

First, build the code:

  scons

Run a single-neuron simulation:

  ./neuron 1

The last command dumped a trace file in trace-1.txt, so let's plot it.

  gnuplot < plot.gnuplot

The included gnuplot script uses the Aqua terminal, so you'll have to
modify it if you're not on Mac OSX.
